## Happy Triple Elimation: Programming Algorithm

> Tempest(tar118@pitt.edu)

A game to teach players what is algorithm practise looks like.
A Match 3 casual game.

Hope you enjoy the HAPPY ELIMINATING and learn some algorithm knowledge.

> This game is developed for [pitt game4social impact 2022](https://itch.io/jam/pitt-games-4-social-impact-2022/entries), I completed development within 1.5 days, which is very challenging.

### Electron Version

I developed an electron version can be installed on Windows/Linux/MacOS. See more to switch the branch to electron.

### Players

-   Everyone who is interested in programming!
-   Everyone who is obsessed in happy eliminating, finding the triplet!s

### Purpose

#### Transform

Through this game, you may learn how to solve algorithm problems in programming, and feel how difficult it is to solve them.

#### Barriers

Players may be not interested in algorithm, programming and triplet eliminating.

#### Game Impact

The happiness players feel

(maybe the spread on social network)

### Scenarios

Players find the triple same elements in a space structure to eliminate them with limited stack to store extra elements.

In this process, there is a window to show the code panel and also teach players some useful programming knowledge to solve questions.
